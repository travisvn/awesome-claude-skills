> A curated list of awesome Claude Skills, resources, and tools for customizing Claude AI workflows

**Claude Skills** teach Claude how to **perform tasks in a repeatable way**

They are specialized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude dynamically discovers and loads when relevant to tasks.

### How Skills Work

Skills employ a **progressive disclosure architecture** for efficiency:

1. **Metadata loading** (~100 tokens): Claude scans available Skills to identify relevant matches
2. **Full instructions** (<5k tokens): Load when Claude determines the Skill applies
3. **Bundled resources**: Files and executable code load only as needed

This design allows multiple Skills to remain available without overwhelming Claude's context window.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Claude.ai Web Interface

1. Go to [Settings > Capabilities](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)
2. Enable Skills toggle
3. Browse available skills or upload custom skills
4. **For Team/Enterprise**: Admin must enable Skills organization-wide first

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
# Install skills from marketplace
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills

# Or install from local directory
/plugin add /path/to/skill-directory
```

### Claude API

Skills are accessible via the `/v1/skills` API endpoint. See the [Skills API documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills) for detailed integration examples.

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client(api_key="your-api-key")
# See API docs for full implementation details
```

### Method 1: Use skill-creator (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a skill is to use the built-in `skill-creator`:

1. Enable the skill-creator skill in Claude
2. Ask Claude: "Use the skill-creator to help me build a skill for [your task]"
3. Answer the interactive questions about your workflow
4. Claude generates the complete skill structure for you

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. **Create folder structure**:

   ```
   my-skill/
   ├── SKILL.md          # Main skill file with frontmatter
   ├── scripts/          # Optional executable scripts
   │   └── helper.py
   └── resources/        # Optional supporting files
       └── template.json
   ```

2. **Create SKILL.md with frontmatter**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: Brief description for skill discovery (keep concise)
   ---

   # Detailed Instructions

   Claude will read these instructions when the skill is activated.

   ## Usage
   Explain how to use this skill...

   ## Examples
   Provide clear examples...
   ```

3. **Add executable scripts** (optional):

   - Python, JavaScript, or other scripts Claude can execute
   - Reference them in your SKILL.md instructions

4. **Test locally**:

   - Install the skill in Claude Code or Claude Desktop
   - Test with relevant tasks
   - Iterate and refine

5. **Share**:

## 💡 Skills vs Other Approaches

### Quick Reference: When to Use What

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Skills** | Reusable procedural knowledge across conversations |
| **Prompts** | One-time instructions and immediate context |
| **Projects** | Persistent background knowledge within workspaces |
| **Subagents** | Independent task execution with specific permissions |
| **MCP** | Connecting Claude to external data sources |

**Use Skills when**: Capabilities should be accessible to any Claude instance. They're portable expertise.

**Use Subagents when**: You need self-contained agents designed for specific purposes with independent workflows and restricted tool access.

**Combined approach**: Subagents can leverage Skills for specialized expertise, merging independence with portable knowledge.

**Key insight**: *If you find yourself typing the same prompt repeatedly across multiple conversations, it's time to create a Skill.*

### Skills vs MCP (Model Context Protocol)

| Feature              | Skills                                        | MCP                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Task-specific expertise and workflows         | External data/API integration     |
| **Portability**      | Same format everywhere (Claude.ai, Code, API) | Requires server configuration     |
| **Code Execution**   | Can include executable scripts                | Provides tools/resources          |
| **Token Efficiency** | 30-50 tokens until loaded                     | Varies by implementation          |
| **Best For**         | Repeatable tasks, document workflows          | Database access, API integrations |

**Use Together**: Skills can create MCP servers! The `mcp-builder` skill helps build high-quality MCP integrations.

#### Skills vs System Prompts

| Feature           | Skills                                              | System Prompts                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Structure**     | Folder with YAML frontmatter, instructions, scripts | Plain text instructions           |
| **Reusability**   | Version-controlled, shareable, composable           | Copy-paste, conversation-specific |
| **Loading**       | On-demand (only when relevant)                      | Always in context                 |
| **Maintenance**   | Centralized updates                                 | Manual updates per conversation   |
| **Composability** | Multiple skills stack automatically                 | Manual combination                |

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Common Questions</strong></summary>

**Q: How much do skills impact token usage?**

A: Skills are highly efficient thanks to progressive disclosure. Each skill uses only ~100 tokens during metadata scanning to determine relevance. When activated, the full skill content loads at <5k tokens. Bundled resources only load as needed.

**Q: What's the difference between Claude Skills and Agent Skills?**

A: They are the same thing.

**Q: Can I share skills with my team?**

A: Yes! Skills can be shared via:

- Git repositories (recommended)
- Internal file sharing
- Claude API for programmatic distribution
- Enterprise-wide deployment features (coming soon)

**Q: Do skills work with all Claude models?**

A: Skills are available for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Free tier users do not have access to Skills.

**Q: Can skills call external APIs?**

A: Yes, skills can include scripts that call external APIs. For complex API integrations, consider using MCP (Model Context Protocol) alongside skills.

**Q: How does Claude decide which skill to use?**

A: Claude scans all available skills' frontmatter (name and description), evaluates relevance to the current task, then loads the full content of relevant skills. Multiple skills can be loaded and composed together automatically.

**Q: Can I use Skills and MCP together?**

A: Absolutely! They complement each other. Use Skills for task-specific workflows and MCP for external data/API integration. The `mcp-builder` skill can even help you build MCP servers.

**Q: Are there any costs beyond my Claude subscription?**

A: No additional costs for using official skills. Community and custom skills are free to use, though some may require external services (APIs, databases, etc.) that have their own costs.

**Q: Can I monetize custom skills?**

A: Currently, there is no official marketplace for paid skills. Anthropic has mentioned plans for community contributions and a potential marketplace in the future.

**Q: How do I update a skill?**

A: For skills from git repositories, pull the latest changes. For manually installed skills, replace the skill folder with the updated version. Always test updates in a non-production environment first.
