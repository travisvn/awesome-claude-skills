## ‚úèÔ∏è Creating Your First Skill

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong></summary>

### Method 1: Use skill-creator (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a skill is to use the built-in `skill-creator`:

1. Enable the skill-creator skill in Claude
2. Ask Claude: "Use the skill-creator to help me build a skill for [your task]"
3. Answer the interactive questions about your workflow
4. Claude generates the complete skill structure for you

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. **Create folder structure**:

   ```
   my-skill/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md          # Main skill file with frontmatter
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/          # Optional executable scripts
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper.py
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/        # Optional supporting files
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template.json
   ```

2. **Create SKILL.md with frontmatter**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: Brief description for skill discovery (keep concise)
   ---

   # Detailed Instructions

   Claude will read these instructions when the skill is activated.

   ## Usage
   Explain how to use this skill...

   ## Examples
   Provide clear examples...
   ```

3. **Add executable scripts** (optional):

   - Python, JavaScript, or other scripts Claude can execute
   - Reference them in your SKILL.md instructions

4. **Test locally**:

   - Install the skill in Claude Code or Claude Desktop
   - Test with relevant tasks
   - Iterate and refine

5. **Share**:
   - Publish to GitHub
   - Submit to this awesome list via PR
   - Share with your team via git repos or internal distribution

### Best Practices

- **Keep descriptions concise** - The frontmatter description is used for skill discovery

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Task-specific expertise and workflows         | External data/API integration     |
| **Portability**      | Same format everywhere (Claude.ai, Code, API) | Requires server configuration     |
| **Code Execution**   | Can include executable scripts                | Provides tools/resources          |
| **Token Efficiency** | 30-50 tokens until loaded                     | Varies by implementation          |
| **Best For**         | Repeatable tasks, document workflows          | Database access, API integrations |

**Use Together**: Skills can create MCP servers! The `mcp-builder` skill helps build high-quality MCP integrations.

### Skills vs System Prompts

| Feature           | Skills                                              | System Prompts                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Structure**     | Folder with YAML frontmatter, instructions, scripts | Plain text instructions           |
| **Reusability**   | Version-controlled, shareable, composable           | Copy-paste, conversation-specific |
| **Loading**       | On-demand (only when relevant)                      | Always in context                 |
| **Maintenance**   | Centralized updates                                 | Manual updates per conversation   |
| **Composability** | Multiple skills stack automatically                 | Manual combination                |

**Key Advantage**: Skills are loaded on-demand, consuming only 30-50 tokens until needed, keeping Claude fast while providing specialized expertise.

<summary><strong>Security Guidelines & Best Practices</strong></summary>

### Vetting Skills

- **Only install skills from trusted sources**
- **Review SKILL.md and all scripts** before enabling a skill
- **Be cautious of skills** that request sensitive data access
- **Audit carefully** before deploying to production or enterprise environments

### Security Concerns

- **Malicious skills** may introduce vulnerabilities or enable data exfiltration
- **Prompt injection attacks** could be amplified through compromised skills
- **Sandboxing limitations** - Understand the security model before enterprise deployment
- **Security research**: [Weaponizing Claude Code Skills](https://medium.com/@yossifqassim/weaponizing-claude-code-skills-from-5-5-to-remote-shell-a14af2d109c9) - Analysis of potential security risks

### Best Practices

- **Version control** - Track all skills in git with proper version tags
- **Code review** - Peer review custom skills before team distribution
- **Least privilege** - Only grant necessary permissions and access
- **Regular audits** - Periodically review installed skills
- **Documentation** - Maintain clear documentation for custom skills
- **Testing** - Thoroughly test skills in non-production environments first

### Enterprise Considerations

- As of October 2025, Claude.ai does not support centralized admin management for custom skills
- Use version control and internal repositories for team skill distribution
- Establish clear policies for skill vetting and approval
- Monitor skill usage and performance

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Known Issues & Common Problems</strong></summary>

### Known Issues

- **Linux path bug (Oct 18, 2025)**: Agent SDK uses hardcoded macOS paths instead of environment home directory

  - [Issue #268](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/268)
  - Workaround: Manually specify skill paths

- **Enterprise distribution**: No centralized admin management yet for custom skills on claude.ai
  - Use git repositories for team distribution
  - API integration provides more control

### Common Problems

**Skills not appearing in Claude**

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Common Questions</strong></summary>

**Q: How much do skills impact token usage?**

A: Skills are highly efficient. Each skill only uses 30-50 tokens until it's loaded. The full skill content only loads when Claude determines it's relevant to the task.

**Q: What's the difference between Claude Skills and Agent Skills?**

A: They are the same thing.

**Q: Can I share skills with my team?**

A: Yes! Skills can be shared via:

- Git repositories (recommended)
- Internal file sharing
- Claude API for programmatic distribution
- Enterprise-wide deployment features (coming soon)

**Q: Do skills work with all Claude models?**

A: Skills are available for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Free tier users do not have access to Skills.

**Q: Can skills call external APIs?**

A: Yes, skills can include scripts that call external APIs. For complex API integrations, consider using MCP (Model Context Protocol) alongside skills.

**Q: How does Claude decide which skill to use?**

A: Claude scans all available skills' frontmatter (name and description), evaluates relevance to the current task, then loads the full content of relevant skills. Multiple skills can be loaded and composed together automatically.

**Q: Can I use Skills and MCP together?**

A: Absolutely! They complement each other. Use Skills for task-specific workflows and MCP for external data/API integration. The `mcp-builder` skill can even help you build MCP servers.

**Q: Are there any costs beyond my Claude subscription?**

A: No additional costs for using official skills. Community and custom skills are free to use, though some may require external services (APIs, databases, etc.) that have their own costs.

**Q: Can I monetize custom skills?**

A: Currently, there is no official marketplace for paid skills. Anthropic has mentioned plans for community contributions and a potential marketplace in the future.

**Q: How do I update a skill?**

A: For skills from git repositories, pull the latest changes. For manually installed skills, replace the skill folder with the updated version. Always test updates in a non-production environment first.
